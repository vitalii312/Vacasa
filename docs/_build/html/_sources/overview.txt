Overview
========

.. automodule:: django_select2
    :members:

External Dependencies
=====================

* Django - This is obvious.
* jQuery - This is not included in the package since it is expected that in most scenarios this would already be available.

Example Application
===================
Please see ``testapp`` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good example.

You need only Django 1.4 or above to run that. It might run on older versions but that is not tested.
