Django-Select2
==============

This is a [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) integration of [Select2](http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/).

The app includes Select2 driven Django Widgets and Form Fields.

More details can be found on my blog at - [http://blog.applegrew.com/2012/08/django-select2/](http://blog.applegrew.com/2012/08/django-select2/).

External dependencies
=====================

* Django - This is obvious.
* jQuery - This is not included in the package since it is expected that in most scenarios this would already be available.
