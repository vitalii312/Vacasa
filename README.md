External Dependencies
=====================

* Django - This is obvious.
* jQuery - This is not included in the package since it is expected that in most scenarios this would already be available.

Example Application
===================
Please checkout `testapp` application. This application is used to manually test the functionalities of this component. This also serves as a good example.

You need only django 1.4 or above to run that.

Changelog Summary
=================

### v2.0.1

* Auto id registration fixes.

### v2.0

* Mostly major bug fixes in code and design. The changes were many, raising the possibility of backward incompatibility. However, the backward incompatibility would be subtle.

* Auto fields (sub-classes of AutoViewFieldMixin) now accepts `auto_id` parameter. This can be used to provide custom id for the field. The default is 'module.field_class_name'. Ideally only the first instance of an auto field is registered. This parameter can be used to force registration of additional instances by passing a unique value.
